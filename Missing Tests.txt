These functions are pending tests once some of the workarounds are removed:
* Intent - enableEncryption()
* Appservice - CryptoStorage
* Appservice - intentOptions.encryption
* Appservice - Decryption
* Appservice - begin#botIntent->enableEncryption automatic

Workarounds:
* Lack of device ID impersonation, requiring login every time
* Store access token from login attempt instead of device ID impersonation

Blockers:
* Unit testing postgresql is not fun
* Unit testing Cryptex is not fun
* Pending Patience-style tests for integration instead of trying to write tests for a lot of this
